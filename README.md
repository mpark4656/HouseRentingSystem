The owner is the user who owns the house and wants it to give it
for rent. The owner will upload all the details of the house,
including the number of rooms, locality, rent. Admin manages all
the users of the system. Customer is the one who is looking for
a rental house. He can search the house according to the
requirements and get the results accordingly.
